"""# NOTES
# to do
## remove the unrated rows
## combine two csvs via anime id
##---------
# reasoning:
## rating column will be removed per instructions
## members column will be removed as it introduces a bias into the final model (more ratings = more users = more popular = good anime, and we do not know the ratings so it is almost "cheating")
